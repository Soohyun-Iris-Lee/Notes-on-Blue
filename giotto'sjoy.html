GIOTTO‚ÄôS JOY
How can we find our way through what separates words from what is both without a name and more than a name: a painting? What is it that we are trying to go through? The space of the very act of naming? At any rate, it is not the space of ‚Äúfirst naming,‚Äù or of the incipient naming of the infans; nor is it the one that arranges into signs what the subject perceives as separate reality. In the present instance, the painting is already there. A particular ‚Äúsign‚Äù has already come into being. It has organized ‚Äúsomething‚Äù into a painting with no hopelessly separate referent; or rather, the painting is its own reality. There is also an ‚ÄúI‚Äù speaking, and any number of ‚ÄúI‚Äôs‚Äù speaking differently before the ‚Äúsame‚Äù painting.
The question, then, is to insert the signs of language into this already-produced reality-sign‚Äîthe painting; we must open out, release, and set side by side what is compact, condensed, and meshed. We must then find our way through what separates the place where ‚ÄúI‚Äù speak, reason, and understand from the one where something functions in addition to my speech: something that is more-than-speech, a meaning to which space and color have been added. We must develop, then, a second-stage naming in order to name an excess of names, a more-than-name become space and color‚Äîa painting. We must retrace the speaking thread, put back into words that from which words have withdrawn.
My choice, my desire to speak of Giotto (1267‚Äì1336)‚Äîif justification be needed‚Äîrelates to his experiments in architecture and color (his translation of instinctual drives into colored surface) as much as to his place within the history of Western painting. He lived at a time when the die had not yet been cast, when it was far from sure that all lines would lead toward the unifying, fixed center of perspective. I shall attempt to relate that experience, that translation, that pivotal historic moment without verbal support from any of these‚Äîexcept for a few anecdotal although not insignificant points, drawn mostly from Giorgio Vasari.
This kind of endeavor locates my strategy somewhere between an immediate and subjective deciphering and a still incoherent, heteroclitic theoretical apparatus yet to be worked out. Primarily, I should emphasize that such an itinerary implicates its subject more than repudiates it under the aegis of a scientific code. This is not an apology; rather, I am calling attention to the dialectical necessity and difficulty now facing any theory of painting that attempts to put forward an understanding of its own practice.

NARRATION AND THE NORM
Giotto‚Äôs pictorial narrative follows biblical and evangelical canon, at Assisi as well as at Padua, deviating from it only to bring in the masses. In those works concerning St. Francis, the Virgin Mary, and Christ, mythical characters resemble the peasants of Giotto‚Äôs time. This sociological aspect, however important it might be to the history of painting, shall not concern me here. Of course, it goes hand in hand with Giotto‚Äôs disruption of space and color; it could not have come about without such a disruption and, in this sense, I could say that it followed.
Christian legend, then, provided the pictorial signified: the normative elements of painting, insuring both adherence to social code and fidelity to ideological dogma. The norm has withdrawn into the signified, which is a narrative. Painting as such would be possible as long as it served the narrative; within the framework of the narrative, it had free rein. A narrative signified cannot constrain the signifier (let us accept these terms for the moment) except through the imposition of continuous representation.
Contrary to a certain kind of Buddhist or Taoist painting, Christian painting experienced the mass arrival of characters with their itineraries, destinies, and histories: in short, their epic. The advent of ‚Äúhistories of subjects‚Äù or ‚Äúbiographies‚Äù‚Äîsymbolizing both phylo- and ontogenetic mutations‚Äîas well as the introduction of the principle of narrative into Christian ideology and art are theoretically justified by Saint Francis and his exegete Saint Bonaventura.
Giotto, along with the changes he effected in respect to modes of conception and composition, brought about a reform in the art of preparing colors. The things of the world receive a stage and a wider opportunity for expression; and this is illustrated by the way Giotto, under the influence of his age, found room for burlesque along with so much that was pathetic. In this tendency of Giotto to humanize and towards realism he never really, as a rule, advances beyond a comparatively subordinate stage in the process.
Thus, in changing color style, Giotto might have given a graphic reality to the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman‚Äù tendencies of the ideology of his time. Giotto‚Äôs colors would be ‚Äúformal‚Äù equivalents of the burlesque, the visual precursors of the earthy laugh that Rabelais only translated into language a few centuries later.
Giotto‚Äôs joy is the sublimated jouissance of a subject liberating himself from the transcendental dominion of One Meaning (white) through the advent of its instinctual drives, again articulated within a complex and regulated distribution. Giotto‚Äôs joy burst into the chromatic clashes and harmonies that guided and dominated the architectonics of the Arena Chapel frescoes at Padua. This chromatic joy is the indication of a deep ideological and subjective transformation; it discreetly enters the theological signified, distorting and doing violence to it without relinquishing it. This joy evokes the carnivalesque excesses of the masses but anticipates their verbal and ideological translations, which came to light later, through literary art (the novel, or, in philosophy, the heresies). That this chromatic experience could take place under the aegis of the Order of Merry Knights commemorating the Virgin is, perhaps, more than a coincidence (sublimated jouissance finds its basis in the forbidden mother, next to the Name-of-the-Father).

PADUA‚ÄôS BLUE
Blue is the first color to strike the visitor as he enters into the semidarkness of the Arena Chapel. Unusual in Giotto‚Äôs time because of its brilliance, it contrasts strongly with the somber coloring of Byzantine mosaics as well as with the colors of Cimabue or the Sienese frescoes. The delicate, chromatic nuances of the Padua frescoes barely stand out against this luminous blue. One‚Äôs first impression of Giotto‚Äôs painting is of a colored substance, rather than form or architecture; one is struck by the light that is generated, catching the eye because of the color blue.
Such a blue takes hold of the viewer at the extreme limit of visual perception. In fact, Johannes Purkinje‚Äôs law states that in dim light, short wavelengths prevail over long ones; thus, before sunrise, blue is the first color to appear. Under these conditions, one perceives the color blue through the rods of the retina‚Äôs periphery (the serrated margin), while the central element containing the cones (the fovea) fixes the object‚Äôs image and identifies its form.
A possible hypothesis, following Andr√© Broca‚Äôs paradox, would be that the perception of blue entails not identifying the object; that blue is, precisely, on this side of or beyond the object‚Äôs fixed form; that it is the zone where phenomenal identity vanishes. It has also been shown that the fovea is indeed that part of the eye developed latest in human beings (sixteen months after birth). This most likely indicates that centered vision‚Äîthe identification of objects, including one‚Äôs own image (the ‚Äúself‚Äù perceived at the mirror stage between the sixth and eighteenth month)‚Äîcomes into play after color perceptions. The earliest appear to be those with short wavelengths, and therefore the color blue.
Thus all colors, but blue in particular, would have a noncentered or decentering effect, lessening both object identification and phenomenal fixation. They thereby return the subject to the archaic moment of its dialectic, that is, before the fixed, specular ‚ÄúI,‚Äù but while in the process of becoming this ‚ÄúI‚Äù by breaking away from instinctual, biological (and also maternal) dependence. On the other hand, the chromatic experience can then be interpreted as a repetition of the specular subject‚Äôs emergence in the already constructed space of the understanding (speaking) subject; as a reminder of the subject‚Äôs conflictual constitution, not yet alienated into the set image facing him, not yet able to distinguish the contours of others or his own other in the mirror. Rather, the subject is caught in the acute contradiction between the instincts of self-preservation and the destructive ones, within a limitless pseudoself, the conflictual scene of primary narcissism and autoerotism whose clashes could follow any concatenation of phonic, visual, or spectral difference.
